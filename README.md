 # Librarymanagement..vin
This system is majorly for the book management.
I have the private, protected and the public member function.
The system has two classes the base class and the inherited class(The derived class).
In the derived class: 
We have the add_new_book fuction which allows the librarian to add books to the library catalogue.
We have the add_to_catalogue function which populates the text file with books record.
We have the view_book fuction which allows the Librarian to view books stored in the database.
We have the update_books fuction. This function basically calls the add_to_catalogue function in order to update the books added to the database.
We have the delete_record function which allows the Librarian to delete the record of the books stored in the Library Catalogue.
we need a way to update upcoming books
we also need a way to delete member records.
